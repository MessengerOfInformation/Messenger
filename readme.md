#Messenger
## Recreating the iPhone Messages app as a webapp for iOS 5.

**Currently a mess.** The plan is to break this apart into some sweet sub-modules and or framework. Going the route of building something that works first and then building the frame around what works and makes sense. So move along. Nothing to see yet.

Using -webkit-overflow-scrolling - so, this only works right on iOS 5 (or a desktop webkit browser).

* Header (animations, page event bindings etc)
* General behavior/logic abstraction?
