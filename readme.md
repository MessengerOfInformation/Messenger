#Messenger
## Recreating the iPhone Messages app as a webapp for iOS 5.

**Currently a mess.** The plan is to break this apart into some sweet sub-modules.

Using -webkit-overflow-scrolling - so, this only works right on iOS 5 (or a desktop webkit browser).

###TODO:

* Consolidate all the scripts - watch and compile
  - Templates
  - Less
  - CoffeeScript
  - Server

* Header (animations, page event bindings etc)
* General behavior/logic abstraction?
* List search bar
* Textfield input behaves weird, animates like crap
* Delete row slide-in animation doesn't happen
* Pull to refresh icon sux + add text label showing state 
* Plugins
